[color=#00ff00][size=6]Informant[/size][/color]

A mod that displays additional information on various objects. It marks inventory items that are still necessary for the bundle, calculates how many days are still left until the harvest and displays what is in a machine and how much time is left on it.

This mod also provides a handy API to extend its functionality.


The mod is automatically present in the game. You just need to move the mouse over the object you wish to get the information from.

If you don’t like one or more of the displayed information (or worse, if there are conflicts with other mods), you can disable each type.


[size=5]Decorators[/size]

There are two decorators, i.e. images displayed on the regular item tooltip, that have a specific meaning:
[list]
[*][img]https://github.com/slothsoft/stardew-informant/raw/main/Informant/assets/bundle.png[/img] [b]Bundles Decorator[/b] - displayed when the item is still needed for the bundles
[*][img]https://github.com/slothsoft/stardew-informant/raw/main/Informant/assets/museum.png[/img] [b]Museum Decorator[/b] - displayed when the item is still needed for the museum
[*][img]https://github.com/slothsoft/stardew-informant/raw/main/Informant/assets/shipping_bin.png[/img] [b]Shipping Decorator[/b] - displayed when the item is still needed to be shipped
[/list]
[size=5]Tooltips[/size]

You can also configure the tooltip “trigger”, i.e. if you want the tooltip to show when the mouse hovers over an object, or if you want to press a key. You can also select the key to press.

On default, of all the big craftable objects in the game, only machines that produce something will get a tooltip. You can configure that to include all craftable objects, or all except chest (if you have a mod that shows specific information for them already).
